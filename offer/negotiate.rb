### Nogotiate
  1) Dont leak your current compensation

    I dont feel comfortable disclosing my current compensation. 
    When I look for jobs, the most important things to me includes: 
      company, technology,the team
    Comp is an important part of my consideration, of course, but I’m sure 
    the company can put together a package that’s 
      competitive in the market and 
      comparable within the company


  3) Making the counter offer:

  "Based on my experience and credentials I think that an annual base salary of $x is an appropriate market rate because [CITE GLASSDOOR, OTHER OFFERS, OTHER MARKET RESEARCH SUCH AS SALARIES FOR SIMILARLY SITUATED EMPLOYEES, ETC.]. Also, given my unique experience [LIST YOUR QUALIFICATIONS], I feel that it would make sense for [COMPANY] to start me at a higher rate of at least $X base."

  4) Their first response might be, sorry, we cant do anything for you. I would advise holding firm at least once:

  "I totally understand where you’re coming from. I really think that this is a great opportunity for me and I think that this is a great team, but at the same time I think that my qualifications are a great fit and are worth a base salary of $x."


  5) They propose something you could be happy with:

  "That’s a great offer. I am really excited about this opportunity but I always like to take my time with important decisions."

  6) End with:

  "When do you need me to get back to you on this?" / "I will definitely get back to you [by Friday / soon]. Thanks again."
